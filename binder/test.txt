Since 1991, when Brian Kelly and I
purchased our stake in the company
and were given the privilege of
managing it, our book value per share
has grown at a compound annual
rate of over 30%. We outperformed
Berkshire Hathaway — who we
consider to be the gold standard of
value creation which returned 14%
compounded since 1991 — by 19
percentage points.
If you had invested $100 in our company
twenty years ago, you would have had
over $3,600 at the end of 2016 — over
eight times more than the $439 from the
S&P 500 over that same period of time.
While the last twenty years have provided
superior returns for shareholders, we
will work hard to continue delivering
value over the next twenty.
In 2016 we delivered record GAAP
revenues of $6.6 billion and record
non-GAAP EPS of $2.18, up 42% and
68% respectively over last year. We
delivered record non-GAAP operating
margins of 35%, and our strongest
annual operating cash flow ever at
$2.2 billion, up 71% over last year.
We have always been fond of generally
accepted accounting principles but our
results do require greater context to
understand, and we encourage you to
read the footnotes in this annual report
for a proper reconciliation to GAAP.
Our performance as a company in 2016
was strong, but before we congratulate
ourselves it is important to understand
these results by operating unit and
with some explanation — particularly
for the areas in which we didn’t do as
well as hoped.
Our Blizzard segment grew
revenues 55% and achieved its first
year with over a billion dollars of
operating profit. This was significant
overperformance against our plan but
does make growth more challenging.
The team at Blizzard is committed to
another year of good performance, but
the substantial overperformance last
year has raised the bar considerably.
Our Activision segment didn’t meet
our 2016 plans, and revenue declined
by 18% compared to 2015. This also
caused us to reduce our plans for
Activision in 2017. We assure you that
lots of effort is being expended to
correct the mistakes we made (there
were quite a few) and we are confident
we will get back on track for growth in
future years.
The King segment was a mixed bag
of success. Live operations helped to
grow engagement, but delays in new
releases made achieving growth in
operating income difficult.
A few non-operating items contributed
to our results this year. Our tax
rate was lower than we expected,
largely due to strong performance
in our international business.
Our financial engineers were as
successful as our software engineers
and as a result, our weighted average
cost of debt decreased by over 170
basis points by the end of 2016. These
items had a favorable impact on our
financial results but aren’t the result
of operating the core business better.
Our new initiatives in consumer
products, television and film, esports
leagues and networks are all off to good
starts. None of these are delivering
operating profits yet, but they will
one day — and we think they could be
significant over the long-term.
Overall, we’re pleased with our
company’s progress in 2016, and our
financial results reflect the unwavering
commitment we have to provide a
superior return to our shareholders.
We deliver these results through an
equally unwavering commitment to
our players.
Our audiences invest billions of hours
a year consuming our content —
roughly 43 billion hours in 2016.
Hundreds of millions of people in
196 countries play our games, watch
our spectator content, buy consumer
products inspired by our franchises,
compete in tournaments and connect
with communities inspired by our
games each month. Our content gives
our audiences joy, and a greater sense
of purpose and belonging. It satisfies
a universal urge for competition, and
adds unique value to people’s lives.
One person whose life has been
touched by our work is Aaron Soetaert,
a 29-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran.
A few years ago, he suffered a terrible
injury and lost his right arm. Aaron
fought to get healthy, and sought
new ways to express his intense
competitive spirit.
Aaron started playing Overwatch.
He plays as the winged hero, Pharah,
and he dominates the skies with
jump jets and hover abilities. Aaron
competes with a team, and is part
of a community that recognizes and
celebrates his skills, allows him to
meet new friends, and enables him
to inspire so many. Watching Aaron’s
character play is thrilling; he talks
to his team, pushes them forward,
and always plays to win. His injury
doesn’t hold him back in Overwatch,
it propels him forward.
This is just one example of the timeless power of communities anchored
through organized competition.
In the 19th century, sports like
football, baseball and basketball
were the hobbies of gifted amateurs.
Then they became professional
leagues organized by bodies
like FIFA, the NFL and NBA. By
investing in developing the games,
talent and community, the value
of sport only grew for our society.
The professionalization of sports
kickstarted a virtuous cycle —
deepening the opportunities to
recognize, reward and celebrate
the achievements of players, by
deepening fans’ sense of belonging
to a community, which in turn gave
us new ways to deepen players’
sense of achievement. Sport got
better, and sport made our lives
better.

Our franchises deliver competitive
experiences as enduring as any
traditional sport. But unlike many
sports, we’ve built experiences that
are broadly accessible — competition
that allows every spectator to be a
competitor, and for almost anyone
to be a star. Our competition is more
global, we reach more people,engage them more deeply, and create
more powerful, lasting connections
thanks to the visceral nature of play
and the breadth of the communities
we support.
This is the thinking that inspired us
when we created Overwatch, a game
designed for online competition, with
memorable characters, an immersive
world, and fast-paced gameplay
designed for the most accessible
competition and compelling viewing.
That world is now a platform in which
millions of people can engage in
gameplay, competition, and connecting
with their friends and community —
and through that platform, we have the
opportunity to create a superior return
to our shareholders through player
investment, and our own investment
in delivering even greater experiences
for the community. This is how we’ve
tapped into the timeless appeal of
sports to create something really
valuable for our players, spectators,
company and investors — and we’ve
been able to do this over and over
again, with Call of Duty, Destiny,
StarCraft and World of Warcraft.
It took many years, and a lot of
innovation and iteration. But we are
building the sports of the future.
The size of the opportunity ahead for
us is vast. Around 240 million people
watch around 7 billion hours of NFL
content annually1, generating $12.0
billion in revenues including $6.1
billion in media rights revenue2; the
NBA has 176 million viewers watching
2.1 billion hours each year1, creating
$5.2 billion in revenues and $1.8 billion
in media rights.2
To broadcast the organized competition
we are creating, we are building
MLG.tv into the first dedicated
channel for professionally produced
esports and the adjacent content that
celebrates and recognizes our players
for their accomplishments. We liken
this to the ESPN of videogames.
We are also working on an advertising
model fit for that future. The quicklygrowing esports audience includes
some of the hardest to reach and
most sought after demographics, with
a share of millennials two to three
times higher than any of the ‘Big
Four’ US sports.3 We will be able to
provide advertisers with direct access
to these fans and better targeting
and analytics than traditional forms
of advertising. Our efforts began with
the idea of providing our King mobile
players with a chance to interact with
high-quality advertising that is native
to the gameplay experience, without
detracting from what our audiences
like best — playing our games.
There are now around 450 million
players in our community. More than
forty billion hours were spent playing
our franchises last year. A record
three billion hours were spent viewing
our games.

Blizzard achieved their most successful new IP launch ever with Overwatch,
their fastest game to reach 25 million
users. World of Warcraft’s Legion
expansion reinvigorated the community, which in the fourth quarter grew
over 20% versus the previous year.
For Activision, Call of Duty: Infinite
Warfare may have got a little lost in
space, but Call of Duty remained the
number one console franchise globally,
and we’re looking forward to new
Call of Duty content and Destiny 2
later this year. King continued to
deliver stable performance on the
strength of a loyal user base.
Each of these results reflects our
consistent focus on serving our
audience. By prioritizing what allows
us to best deliver the values of play,
competition and community, we’ve
worked to do what’s right for our
community today, while also delivering
better experiences into the future.
And that’s how we’re approaching the
opportunities for growth in 2017.
This year, we are focused on
unleashing the full potential of
professional esports by opening up
the sale of teams and media rights
of our leagues. We’re taking the next
step in the evolution of our company
and our community by creating even
more engaging experiences for teams,
players and fans — something we
believe will create immense new
value for our business in the same
way that traditional sports do, through
viewers, broadcast revenues, licensing,
sponsorship and ticket sales.
We also have the opportunity to
connect people in new ways around
our experiences. Through online
advertising, we’re working to serve
our players and global brands, and
early tests of our ad platform on King
have already generated impressive
results in-line with industry leaders.
And with our recently announced
consumer products division, we can
give people more ways to interact with
the franchises they love.
We will continue to stay true to our
principles:
n Delivering innovative and compelling
entertainment experiences
with continuous investment in our
franchises and communities
n Focusing on the largest and most
promising opportunities
n Recruiting, rewarding and retaining
diverse world-class talent, while
maintaining our shared values
n Remaining disciplined in our
commitment to deliver shareholder
value
It remains a great privilege to lead
our company and the extraordinarily
talented people around the world
who are so committed to excellence.
We thank all our stakeholders for their
continuing support and encouragement,
and especially the players like Aaron
Soetaert who inspire us every day.
Sincerely,
Bobby Kotick
President and Chief Executive Officer

The following table summarizes certain selected consolidated financial data, which should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The selected consolidated financial data presented below at and for
each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2016 is derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements. All

(1) During the third quarter of 2016, we early adopted an accounting standard which simplifies the accounting for share-based
payments. The standard, among other things, requires excess tax benefits and shortfalls associated with share-based payments
to be reported within operating activities instead of financing activities, as was required under previous guidance. We elected
to apply this guidance retrospectively for all periods presented resulting in increases in our operating cash flows of
$67 million, $39 million, $29 million, and $5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012,
respectively, when compared to prior periods.
(2) Cash and investments consists of cash and cash equivalents along with short-term and long-term investments. We had
short-term and long-term investments of $13 million and $13 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, $8 million and
$9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, $10 million and $9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2014,
$33 million and $9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2013, and $416 million and $8 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2012. Cash and investments as of December 31, 2015 excludes $3,561 million of cash placed in escrow for the
acquisition of King Digital Entertainment (“King”).

Report.
(4) Net debt is defined as long-term debt, gross less cash and investments.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Business Overview
Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and
distribute content and services across all of the major gaming platforms, including video game consoles, personal computer (“PC”),
and mobile devices.
The King Acquisition
On February 23, 2016 (the “King Closing Date”), we completed the acquisition of King for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $5.8 billion (the “King Acquisition”), as further described in Note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of King commencing on February 23, 2016.
Reportable Segments
Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable operating segments: Activision, Blizzard,
and King.
(i) Activision
Activision Publishing, Inc. (“Activision”), is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and
entertainment content, particularly in console gaming. Activision primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital
downloads, including full-game sales and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party companies
that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets and sells products which are principally based on our internally
developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. Additionally, we have established a long-term alliance with
Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny.
Activision’s key product franchises include: Call of Duty®, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms; Destiny, an online
universe of first-person action gameplay (which we call a “shared-world shooter”) for console platforms; and Skylanders®, a kid’s
game franchise that brings physical toys to life digitally in the game primarily for console platforms. Call of Duty, Activision’s
leading franchise, was the number one console franchise globally in 2016, and in North America for the 8th year in a row, according
to The NPD Group, GfK Chart-Track, and our internal estimates.
(ii) Blizzard
Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (“Blizzard”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and
entertainment content, particularly in PC gaming. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads,
including subscriptions, full-game sales, and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party
companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service which facilitates digital
distribution of Blizzard content, online social connectivity across all Blizzard games, and the creation of user-generated content for
Blizzard’s games.
Blizzard’s key product franchises include: World of Warcraft®, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game
(“MMORPG”) for the PC; StarCraft®, a real-time strategy PC franchise; Diablo®, an action role-playing franchise for PC and console
platforms; Hearthstone®, an online collectible card franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; Heroes of the Storm®, a free-to-play
team brawler for the PC; and Overwatch®, a team-based first person shooter for the PC and console platforms. World of Warcraft is
the leading subscription-based MMORPG and was initially launched in November 2004.
(iii) King
King Digital Entertainment (“King”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services,
particularly on mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS. King also distributes its content and services on online social platforms,
such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King’s games are free-to-play, however players can acquire in-game virtual items, either
with virtual currency the players purchase, or directly using real currency.
King’s key product franchises, all of which are for the PC and mobile platforms, include: Candy Crush™, which features “match
three” games; Farm Heroes™, which also features “match three” games; Pet Rescue™, which is a “clicker” game; and Bubble
Witch™, which features “bubble shooter” games. King had two of the top 10 highest-grossing titles in the United States of America

(“U.S.”) mobile app stores for the last thirteen quarters in a row, according to App Annie Intelligence and internal estimates for Apple
App Store and Google Play Store combined.
(iv) Other
We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:
• The Major League Gaming (“MLG”) business (which we formerly referred to as Activision Blizzard Media Networks or
Media Networks), which is devoted to esports and builds on our competitive gaming efforts by creating ways to deliver a
best-in-class fan experience across games, platforms, and geographies with a long-term strategy of monetization through
advertising, sponsorships, tournaments, and premium content.
• The Activision Blizzard Studios (“Studios”) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content
based on our library of globally recognized intellectual properties, and, in October 2016, released the first season of the
animated TV series Skylanders™ Academy on Netflix.
• The Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide
warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our
own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
Business Results and Highlights
Financial Results
The Company’s 2016 financial highlights include:
• 2016 consolidated net revenues increased 42% to $6.6 billion and 2016 consolidated operating income increased 7% to
$1.4 billion, inclusive of King’s results of operations since the King Closing Date, as compared to consolidated net
revenues of $4.7 billion and consolidated operating income of $1.3 billion in 2015.
• Revenues from digital online channels increased 94% to $4.9 billion in 2016, as compared to $2.5 billion in 2015.
• Operating margin was 21.4% for 2016, compared with 28.3% in 2015. The lower margin was driven primarily by
amortization of intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition.
• We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $2.2 billion in 2016, an increase of 71% as
compared to $1.3 billion in 2015.
• Consolidated net income increased 8% to $966 million in 2016, as compared to $892 million in 2015.
• Our diluted earnings per common share increased 8% to $1.28 in 2016, as compared to $1.19 in 2015.
Since certain of our games are hosted or include online functionality that represents an essential component of gameplay and, as a
result, a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable, we initially defer the software-related revenues from the sale of these games
and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year. Net revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2016 include a net effect of $9 million from the recognition of deferred net revenues.
Also, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the King Acquisition, our net revenues include $1.5 billion and our net
income includes a net loss of $230 million from King’s operations, after adjustments for purchase price accounting, inclusive of
amortization of intangible assets, share-based payments, and deferral of revenues and related cost of revenues. The majority of these
accounting charges under accounting principals generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP”) do not impact the
economics or operating cash flows of our business, although they had a material impact on our 2016 U.S. GAAP results and will have
a material impact on our 2017 U.S. GAAP results.
Release Highlights
Games and digital downloadable content released, among others, during the year ended December 31, 2016 included:
• Four downloadable content packs for Call of Duty: Black Ops III;
• Three content packs for Hearthstone;
• Overwatch;
• Farm Heroes Super Saga™;
• World of Warcraft: Legion™;
• Destiny: Rise of Iron (expansion pack for Destiny);
• Skylanders Imaginators; and
• Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare™, featuring Modern Warfare® Remastered.

Monthly Active Users (“MAUs”): Measuring the Size and Engagement of Our User Base
We monitor MAUs as a key measure of the overall size of our user base and its regular engagement with our portfolio of games.
MAUs are the number of individuals who played a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by
adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the
period. An individual who plays two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for
Activision and King, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as
two users. For Blizzard, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be
counted as a single user.
The number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may
cause a temporary surge in MAUs. Accordingly, although we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a
meaningful performance metric, period-to-period fluctuations may not be indicative of longer-term trends. The following table details
our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for our reportable segments (amounts in millions):
2016
September 30,
2016
June 30,
2016
March 31,
2016
December 31,

Activision ........................................................  46 49 55 55 46
Blizzard ........................................................... 41 42 33 26 26 28
King................................................................. 355 394 409 463 449 474
Total ................................................................ 447 482 491 544 530 548
Average MAUs decreased by 35 million, or 7%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the quarter ended
September 30, 2016. The decrease in King’s average MAUs is due to decreases across King’s franchises that are largely attributable to
less engaged users leaving the network. The increase in Activision’s average MAUs is reflective of the launch of Call of Duty: Infinite
Warfare in November 2016 along with Call of Duty: Black Ops III continuing to have strong MAU retention relative to previous
releases.
Average MAUs decreased by 83 million, or 16%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the quarter ended
December 31, 2015. The decrease in King’s average MAUs is due to decreases across King’s franchises that are largely attributable to
less engaged users leaving the network. This decrease is partially offset by the increase in Blizzard’s average MAUs, driven by the
release of Overwatch in May 2016.
International Sales
International sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that
is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 48%,
48%, and 50% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The
majority of our net revenues from foreign countries is generated by consumers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of
an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies.
Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes
in local economies.
Management’s Overview of Business Trends
Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth
Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of
entertainment, and we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 19% annually over the last four years. The industry continues
to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more common place across age groups and
as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.
Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total
addressable market for gaming significantly. Smart phones and associated free-to-play games have introduced gaming to new age
groups and new regions and allowed gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is now estimated to be larger
than console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games.

In addition, our other segments have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to drive additional player investment
from our franchises.
Opportunities To Expand Franchises Outside of Games
Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full
games or downloadable content or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are
emerging opportunities to drive player investment outside of game purchases. These opportunities include esports, film and television,
and consumer products. Our efforts to build these additional opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially
significant sources of future revenues.
Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises
The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive software industry. According
to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 32% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2016.
Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and
these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy
Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 69% of our consolidated net revenues, and a
significantly higher percentage of our operating income, for 2016.
The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established
franchises. Of the top 10 console franchises in 2016, all 10 are from established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S rankings for
the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of
24 months.
In addition to investing in and developing sequels and content for our top titles, we are continually exploring additional ways to
expand those franchises. Further, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop the future top franchises. In 2014, we released
Hearthstone and Destiny, in 2015, we released Heroes of the Storm, and on May 24, 2016, we released Overwatch. There is no
guarantee these investments will result in established franchises. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase
our presence in the mobile market, on February 23, 2016, we acquired King.
Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of
our, and the industry’s, revenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability
to successfully compete against our competitors’ top franchises can significantly impact our performance.
Recurring Revenue Business Models and Seasonality
Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business to a
more recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our
players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin
revenue, it can also increase engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal.
While our business is transitioning to a year-round engagement model, the interactive entertainment industry remains somewhat
seasonal. We have historically experienced our highest sales volume, particularly for Activision, in the year-end holiday buying
season, which occurs in the fourth quarter. As we make the shift to a year-round model and also now include the operating results of
King, which focuses on free-to-play games, less of our revenues are coming from the fourth quarter. For our reportable segments—
Activision, Blizzard, and King—the percentage of our revenue represented by the fourth quarter in 2016 decreased by 10% year-overyear to 36%, compared with 46% in 2015.
Outlook
In 2017, we will have a lighter slate of full-game releases than 2016, which we expect to result in lower revenues and earnings per
share than we had in 2016. For Activision, we do expect to release the first sequel to Destiny and a new Call of Duty title in the second
half of the year, however, our Skylanders franchise will not have a new full console game launch in 2017. Across our businesses, we
will continue to focus on our opportunities for year-round player engagement and investment.
While our results for 2017 will include the full-year operations of King, the expected results will continue to be impacted by additional
accounting charges associated with the King Acquisition, which include, among other things, integration and acquisition-related costs,
the amortization of intangible assets resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments, and the related tax impact from the King
Acquisition. While the majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics or operating cash flows of our
business, they will have a material impact on our GAAP results.
Finally, one of our current initiatives is to create an esports equivalent of the world’s established major professional sport leagues.
This may provide for additional opportunities in 2017 through strategically important emerging new revenue streams, including
possible team sales for the Overwatch League™, the associated media rights, and in-game advertising.
