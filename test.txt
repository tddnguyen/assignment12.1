People require energy and certain other
essential nutrients. These nutrients are
essential because the body cannot make
them and must obtain them from food.
Essential nutrients include vitamins, minerals,
certain amino acids, and certain fatty acids.
Foods also contain other components such
as fiber that are important for health.
Although each of these food components has
a specific function in the body, all of them
together are required for overall health.
People need calcium to build and maintain
strong bones, for example, but many other
nutrients also are involved.
The carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in
food supply energy, which is measured in
calories. Carbohydrates and proteins provide
about 4 calories per gram. Fat contributes
more than twice as much—about 9 calories
per gram. Alcohol, although not a nutrient,
also supplies energy—about 7 calories per
gram. Foods that are high in fat are also high
in calories. However, many lowfat or nonfat
foods can also be high in calories.
